# EtchASketchFE
Front-end for Etch-A-Sketch project

Built By Minh Chau Ha and Ryan Denlinger

This is the Front end for Etch-A-Fetch.

Back end link: https://github.com/minhl337/EtchASketchBE

To get started:

1) Get the back end up. Instructions are on the readme in the link provided above.

2) Change the following line inside index.js to match your domain and port.
```ruby
const baseUrl = "http://localhost:3000/api/v1"
```
3)Open index.html in your browser.

You can use the left knob or ↑ or ↓ arrows to move the cursor UP/DOWN.
You can use the right knob or ← or → or arrows to move the cursor LEFT/RIGHT.

It works just like a real Etch-A-Sketch so try expermenting with multiple directional inputs!
Enjoy.
